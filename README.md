## Requirements

- **Python 3.6+**
- **PyQt5**
- **Linux operating system** (Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora, RHEL, CentOS, openSUSE, etc.)
- **Administrative privileges** (for package installation)

### Package Manager Requirements

The application automatically detects your system's package manager:

**Traditional Package Managers:**
- **Debian/Ubuntu**: `apt` or `dpkg`
- **Fedora**: `dnf`
- **RHEL/CentOS**: `yum` or `dnf`
- **openSUSE**: `zypper`

**Universal Package Managers:**
- **Snap**: `snapd` (for `.snap` packages)
  ```bash
  # Install snapd
  sudo apt install snapd  # Debian/Ubuntu
  sudo dnf install snapd  # Fedora
  sudo systemctl enable --now snapd
  ```

- **Flatpak**: `flatpak` (for `.flatpak` packages)
  ```bash
  # Install flatpak
  sudo apt install flatpak  # Debian/Ubuntu
  sudo dnf install flatpak  # Fedora
  ```

## Installation

### Option 1: Quick Install (Recommended)

Use the automated installation script that handles everything for you:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Srijan-XI/SnapWiz.git
cd SnapWiz

# Run the installation script
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The `install.sh` script will:
- ✅ Check for Python 3 and pip
- ✅ Install all required dependencies
- ✅ Create a desktop entry for easy access
- ✅ Create a launcher script in `~/.local/bin`
- ✅ Set up the application automatically

After running the script, you can launch the application by:
- Searching for "SnapWiz" in your application menu
- Running `snapwiz` in terminal (if `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH)
- Running `python3 main.py` from the project directory

### Option 2: Manual Installation

If you prefer manual installation or want more control:

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Srijan-XI/SnapWiz.git
cd SnapWiz
```

#### 2. Use a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with system packages:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### 3. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install manually:

```bash
pip install PyQt5
```

#### 4. Make the Script Executable (Optional)

```bash
chmod +x main.py
```

## Usage

### Running the Application

After installation, you can launch the application in several ways:

#### Method 1: From Application Menu (Recommended for Beginners)

1. Open your application menu/launcher
2. Search for "SnapWiz"
3. Click on the icon to launch

#### Method 2: From Terminal (Quick Launch)

If you used the automated installer and `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH:

```bash
snapwiz
```

#### Method 3: From Terminal (Direct Python)

Navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
# If you used the automated installer
cd ~/path/to/SnapWiz
venv/bin/python main.py
```

Or if you installed manually with a virtual environment:

```bash
cd ~/path/to/SnapWiz
source venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

#### Method 4: Direct Execution

If you made main.py executable:

```bash
cd ~/path/to/SnapWiz
./main.py
```

### Adding ~/.local/bin to PATH

If the launcher command doesn't work, add `~/.local/bin` to your PATH:

**For Bash (Most Linux distributions):**
```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

**For Zsh (Kali Linux, modern Ubuntu, macOS):**
```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

**For Fish:**
```bash
fish_add_path ~/.local/bin
```

After this, you can run `snapwiz` from anywhere!

3. **Review package info before installing** - Verify it's what you expect
4. **Keep track of installations** - Use the history feature
5. **Read error messages** - They often tell you exactly what's wrong
6. **Make sure you have enough disk space** - Some packages are large
7. **Use dark mode at night** - It's easier on your eyes!
8. **Try drag-and-drop** - It's the fastest way to add packages to the queue!

## ⚠️ Important Notes and Limitations

### Batch Installation Best Practices

**Recommended Maximum**: **20 packages per batch**
- Large batches (>20 packages) may experience performance issues
- For best experience, split large installations into smaller batches
- The application will still work with more, but installation time increases significantly

**What this means:**
```
✅ Good: Install 15 packages in one batch
⚠️ Acceptable: Install 30 packages (may be slower)
❌ Not Recommended: Install 100+ packages at once
```

### Dependency Resolution

**Known Limitation**: Dependencies between queued packages are **not automatically resolved**

**What this means:**
- If Package B depends on Package A, and both are in the queue
- Package B may fail if it's installed before Package A
- **Solution**: Install packages in dependency order, or install dependencies first

**Example:**
```
❌ Wrong Order:
  1. app-plugin.deb (depends on app)
  2. app.deb

✅ Correct Order:
  1. app.deb
  2. app-plugin.deb
```

**Best Practice:**
- Check package dependencies before batch installation
- Order packages manually in the queue (install dependencies first)
- Or use traditional package managers (apt/dnf) which handle dependencies automatically

### Authentication and Password Prompts

**Known Behavior**: Root password may be requested **multiple times** during batch installation

**Why this happens:**
- Linux security policies (OS limitation, not SnapWiz)
- Each package installation requires privilege escalation
- `pkexec`/`sudo` sessions may timeout between packages

**What to expect:**
```
Installing 5 packages:
  Package 1: Password prompt ✓
  Package 2: (may use cached credentials)
  Package 3: Password prompt again ✓
  Package 4: (may use cached credentials)
  Package 5: Password prompt again ✓
```

**Tips:**
- Keep an eye on the installation process
- Be ready to enter your password when prompted
- For large batches, consider using `sudo` with extended timeout
- This is normal behavior and doesn't indicate an error

### Package Format Specific Notes

**Snap Packages:**
- Require `snapd` service to be running
- Local .snap files are installed with `--dangerous` flag (bypasses signature checks)
- First-time snap installation may take longer due to core snap setup

**Flatpak Packages:**
- Only `.flatpak` bundle files are supported (not repository refs)
- User-level installation is attempted first, then system-wide if it fails
- May require runtime dependencies (handled automatically)

**Traditional .deb/.rpm:**
- Dependency resolution handled by system package manager
- May update package databases automatically
- Internet connection may be required for dependencies

## System Integration

### Creating a Desktop Entry (Optional)

Create a desktop launcher for easy access:

```bash
cat > ~/.local/share/applications/package-installer.desktop << EOF
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Linux Package Installer
Comment=Install .deb and .rpm packages easily
Exec=/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/main.py
Icon=package-x-generic
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=System;PackageManager;
EOF
```

Replace `/path/to/main.py` with the actual path to your `main.py` file.

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied Errors

If you encounter permission errors:

1. Ensure `pkexec` or `sudo` is installed on your system
2. Make sure you enter the correct password when prompted
3. Check that your user account has sudo privileges

### Package Manager Not Detected

If the package manager is not detected:

1. Ensure you're running a supported Linux distribution
2. Install the appropriate package manager:
   - Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install apt`
   - Fedora: `sudo dnf install dnf`
   - RHEL/CentOS: `sudo yum install yum`

### Dependency Errors

If installation fails due to missing dependencies:

1. **For individual packages**: The system package manager tries to resolve dependencies automatically
2. **For `.deb` packages**: `apt` handles dependencies from repositories
3. **For `.rpm` packages**: `dnf`/`yum` handle dependencies automatically
4. **For batch installations**: Dependencies **between queued packages** are NOT resolved
   - See "Important Notes" section above for details
   - Solution: Order packages manually with dependencies first
5. **Manual fix**: Run your package manager's fix command in terminal
   ```bash
   sudo apt --fix-broken install  # For .deb
   sudo dnf check               # For .rpm
   ```

### Package Information Not Showing

If package information is not displayed:

1. Install the required tools:
   - For `.deb`: `sudo apt install dpkg`
   - For `.rpm`: `sudo dnf install rpm` or `sudo yum install rpm`
   - For `.snap`: `sudo apt install snapd`
   - For `.flatpak`: `sudo apt install flatpak`

## Architecture

The application is built with a modular architecture:

```
├── main.py              # Main application and GUI
├── package_handler.py   # Package validation and installation logic
├── logger.py            # Installation history and logging
└── requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
```

### Main Components

- **MainWindow**: PyQt5-based GUI with tabs for installation, history, and settings
- **PackageHandler**: Detects package manager, validates packages, extracts info, and handles installation
- **InstallLogger**: Manages installation history with JSON-based persistence
- **InstallerThread**: Background thread for non-blocking installations

## Security Considerations

- **Elevated Privileges**: The application requires administrative privileges to install packages
- **pkexec**: Uses `pkexec` for secure privilege elevation with GUI authentication
- **Package Validation**: Validates package files before attempting installation
- **Logged Actions**: All installations are logged for audit purposes
